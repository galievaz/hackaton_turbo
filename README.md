# hackaton_turbo
As participant team will need:

1. Select a deep learning framework or service to training a model for turbo charger detection from the images (jpg/png format).
2. Create a web application to allow user to upload a .zip of images (at least 50 images) and process them with the trained model, we will test with at least 50 images. You can find & download example data here. Feel free to download more images from internet for your model trainings. NOTE: the evaluation will not limited to this sample data.
3. Display results of the detected turbos in the uploaded images including the number of turbo charger, the likelihood of detection.
How to submit your result
Commmit all source code to the git repository that we will provided.
Deploy your application to a linux server (we will provide), and update your application address to the last collumn of the register list (Web Application Address).
Evaluation Criteria
The accuracy of the detection.
Detection turbo charger from images is a must.
Text based result is a must including the number or turbo chargers and likelihood of each detection.
The faster the better.
UI is not a priority, but please keep it simple and tidy.

AWS EC2 Instance (t2.medium, 2 vCPU, 4GB Memory, 60GB SSD) for hosting the turbo detection website. - You can apply for this only when you are ready to deploy.
Bitbucket repository to store the source code
